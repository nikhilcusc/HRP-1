# HackerRankProblems (HRP)
## This repo contains my solutions to Hacker Rank problems.

### NOTES:
1. A dictionary maintains order of keys as they were input. So, if 4 came before 3 as a key in the input the dictonary would not sort it and put 3 before 4 in the keys. [Example](/UnNecCompliProblems/UNCP8.py)
1. Range will include the first argument and exclude the second argument. Example:
    >for _ in range(3,6):
    >   print(_)
    >3
    >4
    >5

    Same is true for list indexing. Example:
    > l= [1,3,6,9,22] -> l[2:4] -> [6, 9]

### TODO:
- [ ] In place reversing of doubly linked list.
- [ ] In place merging of sorted Linked list.
- [ ] range update query for multiplication in O(1) time.
